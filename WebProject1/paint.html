<h1>Different Paints:</h1></br>
Paint is any pigmented liquid that after application to a surface (wood,glass,paper,etc) in a thin layer, converts to a solid film.</br>
Paint can be tricky to work with sometimes but it's super fun and very versatile! Some form of  paints are:</br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Oil Paint:</b> This is a slow drying paint that has been mixed with oil to make it waterproof and long-lasting. The viscocity of the paint can change depending on how much paint you put on the surface area. It's a very beautiful medium that takes a little bit to master!
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Acrylic:</b> a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion and plasticizers, silicon oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps.[2] Most acrylic paints are water-based, but become water-resistant when dry. </br>
        Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor, a gouache, or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Gouache:</b> a water-medium, paint consisting of natural pigment, water, a binding agent and sometimes additional inert material.</br>
        Gouache is designed to be opaque. Gouache has been used for a long time! It's like a thicker water-color.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Pastel:</b> an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are similar to those used to produce some other colored visual arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation.</br>
        The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. It may be weird,but this form of painting is called "dry painting"!
